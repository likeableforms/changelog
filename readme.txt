Create advanced contact forms with easy-to-use features like drag and drop and advanced features like conditional logic.

== Description ==

Build dependable, scalable, stunningly designed contact forms. With <a href="https://likeableforms.com">Likeable Forms</a> you can easily create advanced contact forms with easy-to-use features like drag and drop, build dynamic forms with advanced features like conditional logic and field mapping, create rich dynamic outgoing email notifications with full HTML support, preview form submissions from within the plugin, and power up with marketplace extensions.


<h4>Beginner Friendly Drag and Drop Functionality</h4>

Our sleek dark-mode enabled drag and drop form builder comes packed with advanced developer like features out-of-the-box. Simply drag or click a field to start building new forms! Effortlessly add, duplicate, delete, and sort fields. Designed to be the most intuitive drag and drop form builder plugin with advanced highlighted color changing drop zone indicators. 


<h4>Responsive and Cross Browser Compatible</h4>

Create professional and responsive contact forms. Our "part of the web" inspired design framework includes pixel-perfect designs. Fully compatible with all major browsers, devices, and virtually all brands. Automatically create stunning out-of-the-box designed contact forms without writing a single line of CSS.


<h4>Build Dynamic Form Notifications with Field Mapping</h4>

Create outgoing email notifications with a dedicated notifications tab that feels just like an inbox. Map dynamic form data, add custom HTML to create beautiful emails, include file uploads as attachments to one or multiple team members or recipients. Select a company email to look even more professional. Ensure email deliverability by using one of our SMTP extensions such as the Amazon Web Server (AWS) SMTP extension.


<h4>Form Security & Validation</h4>

Complex validation, sanitization and prepared statements are pre-implemented to help protect against spammers and malicious attackers.  More secure than client-side validation is server side validation. Likeable Forms does both. Our server-side form validation provides instant feedback to the user if form validation fails. Likeable Forms adheres to all of the latest WordPress Coding Standards and plugin security recommendations.   


<h4>Build Advanced & Custom Forms with Conditional Logic</h4>

Show or hide fields with conditional logic. Use other fields, math, static, and/or dynamic form values as your conditions to alter the form fields that appear in your form. Add as little or as many rules as you need!


<h4>Marketplace Extensions</h4>

Here are just a few marketplace extensions you can download to build custom payment forms, newsletter subscriber forms, PDF & legally-binding signature forms, add new tickets to your companies favorite CRM, collaborate with team members, send programmable SMS notifications to customers, and/or ensure email deliverability.
